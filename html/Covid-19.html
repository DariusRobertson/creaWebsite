        <p style="color: white;">Cary Street Tattoo’s top priority is the health and safety of our community. We are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone who enters our doors.

            All of our artists and staff are required to maintain up to date certifications in first aid, blood borne pathogens and cpr training as well as a minimum of six hours of continuing education annually.
            
            As body modification professionals we follow universally all standard precautions for infection prevention and control required by the VA DPOR, OSHA and the CDC.
            
            In order to help prevent the potential spread of coronavirus we are implementing additional measures as recommended by the World Health Organization.
            
            Listed below are just a few of the many measures we are taking to ensure the well being of our clients and staff.
            
            Disposable face masks, antibacterial hand wipes and hand sanitizer is provided for all clients as they enter our lobby.
            
            Commonly touched surfaces such as door knobs, jewelry cases, tables, chairs and portfolios are wiped down between appointments.
            
            Items such as clipboards, pens and our touch screen register are disinfected after each use.
            
            Artist’s work areas are cleaned before and after each procedure. Personal protective equipment such as disposable aprons, sleeves and face masks have been made available to our staff.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Our artists’ wash their hands not only before and after each tattoo but also anytime there is a break in service such as after handling money, smoking a cigarette, eating food, using the restroom, or touching a cell phone whether it’s ours or a clients.
            
            Hand rubbing with sanitizer for 20-30 seconds may be used in place of hand washing when they are simply changing gloves and have not left their work area such as setting out new ink, refilling paper towels adjusting references etc.
            Hand washing remains the most effective method of preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
            
            We encourage all our clients, staff and artists to wash their hands often with soap and water for 40-60 seconds, especially after going to the restroom, before eating, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
            
            Additionally, we ask that any of our clients let us know if they have traveled to any affected area or who have had close contact with any person who may be sick, to reschedule their appointments until they have been symptom free for at least two weeks.
            
            If you or a loved one are experiencing flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath, please stay home when you are sick until you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours.
            
            We are monitoring the situation and preparing for the possibility that our shop hours could be temporarily impacted if the situation significantly worsens. We will keep you all updated with information as it develops.
            
            Additionally, we encourage everyone to regularly check the CDC’s website and the Virginia Department of Health for important updates and safety information.
